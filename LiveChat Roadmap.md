---

## 1. Executive Goal

The current system is a solid communication tool. To maximize ROI, we must shift focus from "Talking" to "Converting". The following roadmap outlines the high-impact features required to achieve this.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: The "Zero Missed Opportunities" Layer (Stability)

**Focus:** Ensure no lead slips through cracks.

-   **Intelligent Routing:** Auto-assign chats to the next available agent (Round Robin). Stop waiting for agents to "click" take.
-   **Smart Shortcuts (`/canned`):** Type `/price` to auto-expand pricing tables. Speed = Revenue.
-   **CRM Integration:** Add "Lead Status" tags (Hot, Warm, Cold) and Private Notes to visitor profiles.

---

## ⚡ Phase 2: The "Aggressive Conversion" Layer (Growth)

**Focus:** Proactively turn visitors into conversations.

-   **"Sneak Peek" (Typing Preview):** See what the visitor is typing _before_ they hit send. Agents can have the answer ready instantly. (High "Wow" factor).
-   **Smart Triggers:** "You've been on the Pricing page for 2 minutes. Need help?" (Auto-invite).
-   **Rich Messages:** Send "Product Cards" or "Book a Demo" calendars directly in chat, not just text links.

---

## 📊 Phase 3: The "Founder's Dashboard" (Management)

**Focus:** ROI and Accountability.

-   **Advanced Analytics:** Track Response Time per Agent, Conversation Conversion Rate, and Peak Hours.
-   **Post-Chat Surveys:** Simple 5-star rating after chat closes to monitor quality.
-   **Busy Hours Heatmap:** Staffing optimization.

---

## 🛡️ Phase 4: Technical Robustness (Long Term)

-   **Mobile App / PWA:** Push notifications for agents on the go.
-   **Webhooks:** Send lead data to Salesforce/HubSpot/Slack automatically.
